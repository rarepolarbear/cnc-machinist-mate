# **App Name**: CNC Machinist Mate

## Core Features:

- Parameter Input: Input parameters for circular interpolation on a Haas CNC mill.
- G-code Generation: Generate G-code block based on user parameters for circular interpolation, making sure that the result follows all safety and machine-specific constraints. This AI powered tool incorporates complex machining logic for optimal results.
- G-code Display: Display the generated G-code in a 'copypasta' block.
- Copy to Clipboard: Implement a one-click copy button to easily copy the G-code.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080). Evokes a sense of precision, calmness, and technical expertise, complementing the nature of CNC machining.
- Background color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF). This light background ensures comfortable readability and complements the teal primary color.
- Accent color: Lime green (#32CD32). Adds a vibrant, attention-grabbing element without overwhelming the professional aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable interface.
- Use clear, concise icons to represent different input parameters and actions.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the G-code generation process.
- Subtle animations (e.g., button hover effects, copy confirmation) to enhance user interaction without being distracting.
